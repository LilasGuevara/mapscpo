The goal of this code is to create an interactive map of international exchanges, available at Sciences Po, a French university. 

The main idea is to enable each person insterested in those exchanges to query and find a university on the map using the search bar with corresponding filters : Langages / Universities / Assignments / Undergrad / Graduate
